# Recognition-of-Human-Arm-Gestures
Gesture recognition using MATLAB
There are specifically 4 files, namely
  1. Images
  2. Myo Armband Codes
  3. Automated Code
  4. Psychtoolbox Code

The Image folder contains all the images that were shown to the subject when the data was 
being collected.

The Myo Arm Band Code folder conatins all the Necessary codes required to connect the myo armband 
to MATLAB - Coded by Celal Savur (MABL, RIT)

Automated code refers to the code that was being used real-time to detect the gesture.

Psychtoolbox code refers to the code that was constructed to perform data collection.

The automated code includes the availability of models, but these models are not included as those were created specific to the subject.
